We propose to develop an app that will not only provide users with an elegant solution to tracking their workout metrics with an easy-to-use user interface but also provide users the option to limit time spent at the gym waiting for equipment and an ever-growing community of members to connect with and draw inspiration from.

Database: FireBase
Type: Mobile App

This app will include:
  * Calorie Counter
  * Workout Routines
  * Recording Workouts
